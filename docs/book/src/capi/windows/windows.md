# Windows

## Configuration

The `images/capi/packer/config/windows` directory includes several JSON files that define the default configuration for the Windows images:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `packer/config/windows/ansible-args.json` | A common set of variables that are sent to the Ansible playbook |
| `packer/config/windows/cloudbase-init.json` | The version of [Cloudbase Init](https://github.com/cloudbase/cloudbase-init) to install |
| `packer/config/windows/common.json` | Settings for things like which runtime (Docker or Containerd), pause image and other configuration |
| `packer/config/windows/kubernetes.json` | The version of Kubernetes to install and it's install path |
| `packer/config/windows/containerd.json` | The version of containerd to install |

## Using the Ansible Scripts directly

Ansible doesn't run on directly on Windows (wsl works) but can used to configure a remote Windows host.  For faster development you can create a VM and run Ansible against the Windows VM directly with out using packer. This document gives the high level steps to use Ansible from Linux machine.

## Set up Windows machine
Follow the documentation for configuring WinRm on the Windows machine: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_setup.html#winrm-setup. Note the [ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1) is for development only.  Refer to [Ansible WinRM documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_winrm.html) for details for advance configuration.

After WinRM is installed you can edit or `/etc/ansible/hosts` file with the following:

```
[winhost]    
<windows ip>

[winhost:vars]
ansible_user=username
ansible_password=<your password>
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
```

Then run: `ansible-playbook -vvv node_windows.yml --extra-vars "@example.vars.yml`

## MacOS with ansible
The Winrm connection plugin for Ansible on MacOS causes connection issues which can result in `ERROR! A worker was found in a dead state`. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_winrm.html#what-is-winrm for more details.

To fix the issue on MacOS is to set the no_proxy environment variable. Example:

```
'no_proxy=* make build-azure-vhd-windows-2019'
```
